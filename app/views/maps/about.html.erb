</p>
<p>
CityEatouts is a project by Santosh Wadghule @ <a href ="/">cityeatouts.com</a>. I made cityeatouts because I realized that every one gets difficult to find out cool and best places to eat. People want good, fresh food with full of fun environment. CityEatouts helps to find out cool eat out places in the city, near you.
</p>

<p>Using google maps you can share your address of eat out places to your friends and family.
